# Social Network Analysis Teaching Materials

This includes all of the code and data I use when teaching social network analysis with Peter Bearman. When we teach the course, each week (or day if it is a short course) has a set of readings with a corresponding R tutorial. The tutorials cover both general programming in R and specifics for working with network data. Besides the first two, the tutorials have the goal of recreating network graphs and analyses shown by Peter in his lecture slides. Those slides are not included here, but many of the graphs come from papers written by Peter Bearman, James Moody and others, and so they can reasonably be found elsewhere.

All of the R code here is yours to use. The data however is not - so please send me an email at mh3279@columbia.edu if you would like to use it for teaching or research purposes. Feel free to email if you have other questions too.
